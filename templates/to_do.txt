These need to be converted to fit the current template pages in the stocks folder.
Just for things like the Login and register screen, for example no longer using username.
Then have to make the html work with the flask form.

Also may be worth changing the layout slightly, since all the pages share the same banner at the top if you make a layout.html and then just use extends layout (Look into the layout and home pages in the Stocks folder for refernce)
Also need to remove the .* files from this folder
